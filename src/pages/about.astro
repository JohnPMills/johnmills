    I hold a doctorate in transformational leadership and social cognition and have over a decade of experience researching performance, wellbeing, and integrity. My career as a researcher, advisor, and non-profit director has allowed me to work with a diverse range of organisationsâ€”including universities, global organisations, and professional sports teamsâ€”toward improving their organisational culture, policies, and practices. Throughout my career, I have developed and validated a range of programmes and tools addressing topics such as psychological first aid, anti-doping, coaching efficacy, and open science. This work, combined with my expertise in social psychology, positions me to help organisations create impactful, evidence-based solutions that improve performance and foster integrity.
    Iâ€™ve worked with organisations such the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), Movember, the League Managers Association, and various professional sports teams, conducting reseach to improve aspects of their service, designing tailored programmes, and offering strategic advice. In my role as an Open Science Advisor, Iâ€™ve implemented organisational reviews, conducted research, advised on the creation of policies related to recognition and rewards and open science, and delivered training to support cultural transformation.
    Whether advising on leadership development, open science initiatives, or organisational change, I work with a wide range of organisationsâ€”from charities and non-profits to global entities and sports organisationsâ€”to help them build cultures that value performance, wellbeing, and ethical practices.
