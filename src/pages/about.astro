    Leadership and Organisational Change: I utilise theories from within my training as a psychologist and leadership expert to drive sustainable organisational change. Through my research and thought leadership, I demonstrate how organisations can align their values and policies with ethical standards to foster meaningful organisational growth.
    
    Research Integrity and Open Science: My work in research integrity and open science highlights the importance of transparency and ethical practices in academic and research institutions. I advocate for the implementation of open science practices and ethical standards that build credibility, enhance collaboration, and fulfil our civic responsibilities.
